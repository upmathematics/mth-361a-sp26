## Statistical Thinking: An Overview

**What is statistical thinking?**

A way of understanding the world through data.

```{r statistical-thinking-1, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Statistical Thinking in the Data Science Life Cycle", fig.align='center', out.width = '55%'}

$\star$ Statistical thinking is our guiding principle as we learn statistical concepts and techniques.
:::

## Example 1: Statistical Question

*Question:* **What is the crime rate in Portland, OR?**

This question requires:

  1. Data collection from a representative sample of neighborhoods in Portland.
  2. Statistical analysis to estimate the average crime rate.

## Example 1: Preparation

*Question:* **What is the crime rate in Portland, OR?**

The analysis anticipates:

  1. **Variability.** No two neighborhoods will produce exactly the same result.
  2. **Uncertainty.** Because data varies, we’re often unsure about the "true" answer to the question.
  3. **Context.** Numbers alone don’t tell the whole story. You need to consider the situation, the method of data collection, and any potential biases.

## Example 1: Data Visualization

```{r portland-crime-rates, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Portland crime rates in fiscal year 2020 to 2021.", fig.align='center', out.width = '55%'}
knitr::include_graphics("reported-crimes-per-1000- fy-2020-2021.png")
```

## Example 1: Data Exploration

*Follow-up question:* **What types of crimes are usually reported?**

```{r portland-types-of-crimes, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Portland types of crimes in year 2020 to 2021.", fig.align='center', out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("types-of-crimes- fy-2020-2021.png")

**Steps in Statistical Thinking:** 

  1. Ask a question or identify a problem
  2. Collect data, understand variability, identify patterns and relationships
  3. Apply statistical analysis
  4. Evaluate results and make a conclusion or predict an outcome
